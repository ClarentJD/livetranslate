# Live translate

Idea is to watch something Russian with my Brazilian girlfriend and project
live translation on a screen.

For now it is listening to the microphone, transcribe the speech and translates
it using GPT3 (much faster and cheaper than GPT4).

Works ok after a couple of hours of work, it is looking promising: but it is
far from complete.
